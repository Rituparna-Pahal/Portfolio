Tailwind Setup Info

This project is built using the latest version of Tailwind CSS with the CLI setup.
There is no "tailwind.config.js" file included.

Instead of using a config file, all the customizations like extended colors, spacing, etc., are done directly in the "input.css" file using Tailwind's new @layer and @theme feature.
This method is supported in the latest versions of Tailwind and helps keep things simple.
